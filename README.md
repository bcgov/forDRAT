## Overview

bcgov/forDRAT contains data by the BC Ministry of Forests about historical and projected future drought risk in mature forests in the province.  


## Introduction

The 'forDRAT' package provides an estimate of drought risk in mature forests across different tree species, biogeoclimatic units and relative soil moisture regimes.  The modeling approach is described in [DeLong et al. (2019)](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/Docs/Tr/TR125.pdf).  

## Data
The package contains the following file in the *data* folder: 

- *forDrat.csv* - a .csv file that lists estimated risk of drought-related mortality in mature forest stands.  

The file contains the following columns:

1. BGC - lists the BGC variant.  BGC variants were identified from BEC v11.
2. Period - data are listed for two historical periods: (i) 1961-1990 and (ii) 1981-2010, as well as three future scenarios: (i) 2020; (ii) 2050; and (iii) 2080.
3. SMR_text - text description of relative soil moisture regime (RSMR), ranging from xeric to subhygric.  Sites with RSMR wetter than subhygric are not considered in this model.
4. SMR- integer description of RSMR, with 1 = xeric; 2 = subxeric; and so on.
5. AET_PET - the mean annual ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration.  See [DeLong et al. (2019)](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/Docs/Tr/TR125.pdf) for details.
6. The remaining columns describe drought risk by tree species.  Each column name represents a tree species code, with codes being listed [here](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/tree-seed/tree-seed-centre/seed-testing/codes).  *Please note that forDRAT currently only considers interior species*. The following drought risk codes are used; (i) L = low; (ii) M = moderate; (iii) H = high; and (iv) VH = very high.


## Additional details

The drought risk estimates were generated using a water-balance modeling approach as implemented in the Tree and Climate Assessment (TACA) model developed by [Nitschke and Innes (2008)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304380007004061?via%3Dihub).  

The TACA model uses daily climate data, which are sparse in the province.  In order to provide drought-risk estimates for all biogeoclimatic units in the province, we used the PNWNAmet gridded daily climate dataset, developed by [Werner et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018299).  More information and dataset download are available [here](https://www.pacificclimate.org/data/daily-gridded-meteorological-datasets).  *We plan to publish an extension note that details how the PNWNAmet dataset was used in TACA and forDRAT.*

Future daily climate data was generated by adding monthly climate change projection anomalies for the different future climate model periods (2020 = 2011-2040, 2050 = 2041-2070, 2070 = 2071-2100) from [ClimateBC](https://climatebc.ca/) version 6.21, 15-model ensemble of the RCP 4.5 emission scenario (DeLong et al. 2022, Wang et al. 2006).
